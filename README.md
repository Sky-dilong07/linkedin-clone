# LinkedIn Clone - Phase 1 (Setup)

This is the Phase 1 skeleton for the LinkedIn Clone assignment.

## How to run locally

1. Ensure XAMPP is installed and **Apache is running**.
2. Place this folder in your XAMPP htdocs: `D:\xampp\htdocs\linkedin-clone`.
3. Open in browser: `http://localhost/linkedin-clone/`.
4. Database is not required for Phase 1 — we'll add DB in Phase 2.

## Next steps
